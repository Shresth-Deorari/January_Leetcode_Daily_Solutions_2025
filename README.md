# LeetCode Solutions - January 2025

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems solved in January 2025. The solutions are implemented in C++ and focus on providing just the function implementations that LeetCode accepts. Each solution is accompanied by a brief description of the problem it solves.

## Solution Format

Each solution is provided in a separate file with the following structure:

 ``` cpp
  class Solution {
  public:
      // Function signature
      ReturnType functionName(Parameters) {
          // Implementation
      }
  };
  ```

class Solution: Contains the function that solves the problem.
Function signature: Matches the signature expected by LeetCode.
Implementation: Contains the logic to solve the problem.

## Problem List

Below are the solutions to LeetCode problems solved in January 2025, organized by date:

- **Januray 1, 2025**
  - [January_1](January_1.cpp)

- **Januray 2, 2025**
  - [January_2](January_2.cpp)

## Usage

Since this repository contains only the function implementations, you can copy the relevant function into the LeetCode online editor to test it. 

For example, if you want to use the solution for the daily problem asked on January 1, 2025, copy the contents of `January_1.cpp` into the LeetCode editor.
